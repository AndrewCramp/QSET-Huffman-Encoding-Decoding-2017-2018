# Hufman Encoding

### HuffmanEncoder.c
Generates Huffman codes using testfile.txt as input, and outputing to codes.txt

### HuffmanDecoder.c
Uses the codes.txt file generated by HuffmanEncoder.c to decode a Huffman transmission stored in the transmissions.txt file. decoded transmission is outputed to the console.

### structures.h
Header file for main.c contains the struct for the node array.

### testfile.txt
Input file for main.c list of messages for the satellite to send. Messages must be written using uppercase letters. Messages can be put on sepperate lines.

### codes.txt
Output of main.c contains a list of alphnumeric characters (A-Z + 0-9) with their corresponding codes generated by the Huffman algorithm. Each letter/number is on a seperate line with it's corresponding code for example:  
A0100  
B00100  

### transmission.txt
Stores Huffman transmission to be decoded (1s correspond to dashes, and 0s correspond to dots). Transmission must be on only one line with no spaces. Example:  
0000010101100000
